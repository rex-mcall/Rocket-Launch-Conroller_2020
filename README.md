## Changes
This is the 2020 updated code for my model rocket launch system. The new code goes along with the addition of a 
Bluetooth module to the hardware suite. It is much better written than the 2018 code and has changes such as:
- Better code organization
- Improved variable naming to follow standard conventions
- Custom header files to organize function prototypes
- Multiple files for the code; one file for the main loop and one for the functions
